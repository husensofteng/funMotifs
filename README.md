regMotifs is developed to annotate transcription factors (TF) with functional annotations. The main module is src/regMotifsMain.py
Parameters to specify the input files and other parameters should be given in a configuration file. An example of such configuration file is provided in conf/main_parameters.conf

The datafiles that are specified in the main_parameters.conf have to be available for the tool to run. Please follow ReadMe files listed in the ReadMe directory to generate input datafiles and annotations for running regMotifs.
A complete set of datafiles are prodvided to re-generate the annotated motifs that are reported in the current version of regMotifsDB. They can be downloaded on: bioinf.icm.uu.se/regMotifs or on ULAM (/data1/husen/datafiles.tar.gz)
